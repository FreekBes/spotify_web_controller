# Spotify Web Controller
A web controller for Spotify, targeted for Android Go, because I've heard the official Spotify application runs like shit and sometimes you just wanna control what's playing without getting up from bed or something

It's currently available at https://freekb.es/spotify/

*Reminder that you need to open Spotify on another device in order for this to function correctly (or the same one, actually, but why would you do that)*

## Supported features
- an overview of the user's library: playlists and saved albums
- searching for songs, albums and playlists
- overview of all songs in the album/playlist that's currently being played (a replacement for the queue, as the queue is sadly not fetchable with Spotify's API)
- changing the playback volume
- switching between devices using Spotify Connect
- liking and unliking the currently playing song
- enabling and disabling shuffle, repeat

## Possible features that I might add one day
- support for podcasts
- simple artist overviews
- album & playlist overviews
- adding tracks to the queue
- liking and unliking tracks not currently being played
- liking and unliking playlists, albums
- browse through your recommendations
- category playlists
- liked & recently played songs overview
- small overview of your top played artists and songs
- media control notification
